This repo contains a collection of examples showing how to use the Yoink web
framework.

Each subdirectory contains a standalone webserver in 'server.go' and client
code in its 'index.js'.  [hello](examples/hello/) is a minimal webpage using
Yoink.  [canvas](examples/canvas/) introduces the 'dom.js', used to create
DOM elements.  [react](examples/react/) shows how to test dynamic content
with 'observable.js' and 'assert.js'.  Finally, the [layout](examples/layout/)
example demonstrates how to use 'layout.js' to create custom elements.
